# 11. Recipe Image API

Building a Recipe Image API involves adding support for handling image data, which is crucial for a feature-rich recipe
application. This step involves integrating image handling dependencies into your application.

## Step 1. Adding Image Handling Dependencies

**Updating the Dockerfile**

In the Dockerfile, you need to add dependencies necessary for handling JPEG images and other image formats. This 
typically involves adding image libraries like **jpeg-dev** and **zlib**.

Here's how you update your Dockerfile:

```yaml
# Other lines

...
RUN python -m venv /py && \
    /py/bin/pip install --upgrade pip && \
    apk add --update --no-cache postgresql-client jpeg-dev && \           <- jpeg-dev
    apk add --update --no-cache --virtual .tmp-build-deps \
    build-base postgresql-dev musl-dev zlib zlib-dev linux-headers && \   <- zlib
```

**Adding Pillow to Requirements**

Pillow is a Python Imaging Library that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image 
file formats. It's a crucial dependency for handling images in Python applications.

Update your **requirements.txt** file to include Pillow:

```text
Pillow>=8.2.0,<8.3.0
```

**Building the Docker Image**

After updating the Dockerfile and the requirements, you need to rebuild your Docker image to include these new 
dependencies.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```commandline
docker-compose build
```

**Key Points**

- **JPEG and zlib**: These libraries are essential for handling JPEG images and compression, which are common
requirements in image processing.
- **Pillow**: This library is widely used in Python applications for image processing tasks. It's robust and supports
a wide range of image formats.
- **Rebuilding the Docker Image**: It's crucial to rebuild your Docker image to ensure that these new dependencies are
correctly installed in your Docker environment.

With these updates, your application will be equipped to handle image data, paving the way for features like uploading 
images for recipes, which can significantly enhance the user experience in your recipe application.

## Step 2. Configuring Project for Static Files

To handle image files effectively in your Django project, you need to configure it to manage static and media files 
properly. This setup involves adjustments to your Docker configuration, **docker-compose.yml**, and Django settings.

**Updating the Dockerfile**

In the Dockerfile, create directories for media and static files and set the appropriate permissions. 
This step ensures that your application has designated places to store these files.

Here's the update to your Dockerfile:
```yaml
# Other lines...

    adduser \
        --disabled-password \
        --no-create-home \
        django-user && \
    mkdir -p /vol/web/media && \
    mkdir -p /vol/web/static && \
    chown -R django-user:django-user /vol && \
    chmod -R 755 /vol && \
```
After updating, rebuild your Docker image:

```commandline
docker-compose build
```
**Updating docker-compose.yml**

In your **docker-compose.yml**, define volumes for static and media data. This step is crucial for data persistence and
to ensure that your media files are not lost when Docker containers are restarted or rebuilt.
```yaml

# Other lines...

services:
  # Configuration for your services...
  -
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app
      - dev-static-data:/vol/web

# Other lines...
volumes:
  dev-db-data:
  dev-static-data:
```

**Updating Django Settings**

Configure Django settings to handle static and media files. This includes setting the URLs and the root 
directories for static and media files.

In **settings.py**:
```python
# settings.py

# Other settings...
STATIC_URL = '/static/static/'
MEDIA_URL = '/static/media/'

MEDIA_ROOT = '/vol/web/media'
STATIC_ROOT = '/vol/web/static'
```

**Configuring URL Patterns for Media Files**

In **app/app/urls.py**, add URL patterns for serving media files in development. This is necessary for Django to
serve media files during development.

```python
# app/app/urls.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static
# Existing URL patterns...

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(
        settings.MEDIA_URL,
        document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT,
    )
```

**Key Points**

- **Dockerfile Setup**: Creating and setting permissions for the /vol/web/media and /vol/web/static directories ensure 
that Django has the necessary directories to store media and static files.
- **Volumes in docker-compose.yml**: Defining volumes for static and media files ensures that these files are persisted
outside the Docker containers.
- **Django Settings**: Setting **MEDIA_URL**, **MEDIA_ROOT**, **STATIC_URL**, and **STATIC_ROOT** configures Django to
correctly handle media and static files.
- **Media Files URL Pattern**: Adding URL patterns for media files in development mode allows Django to serve these files
while developing locally.

With these configurations in place, your Django application will be able to handle static and media files effectively,
which is crucial for the Recipe Image API and any other features involving file uploads or static content.

## Step 3. Modifying the Recipe Model to Include Image Handling

To support image uploads for recipes, you need to modify the Recipe model to include an image field. This step involves
creating a function to generate a file path for each new image and updating the Recipe model to use this function.

**Writing a Test for Image File Path Generation**

In **core/tests/test_models.py**, write a test to ensure that the image file path is generated correctly. 
This test will mock UUID generation to predict the output file path.

```python
# core/tests/test_module.py
from unittest.mock import patch

class ModelTests(TestCase):
    """Test models."""
    
    # Other tests...
    
    @patch('core.models.uuid.uuid4')
    def test_recipe_file_name_uuid(self, mock_uuid):
        """Test generating image path."""
        uuid = 'test-uuid'
        mock_uuid.return_value = uuid
        file_path = models.recipe_image_file_path(None, 'example.jpg')

        self.assertEqual(file_path, f'uploads/recipe/{uuid}.jpg')
```

**Modifying the Recipe Model**

In **app/core/models.py**, define a function `recipe_image_file_path` to generate a unique file path for each recipe image.
Also, add an image field to the Recipe model using this function for the `upload_to` argument.

```python
# app/core/models.py

import uuid
import os

def recipe_image_file_path(instance, filename):
    """Generate file path for new recipe image."""
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1]
    filename = f'{uuid.uuid4()}{ext}'

    return os.path.join('uploads', 'recipe', filename)

class Recipe(models.Model):  
    # other fields...
    image = models.ImageField(null=True, upload_to=recipe_image_file_path)

```
**Creating Database Migrations**

After updating the model, create new migrations to reflect these changes in your database schema:
```commandline
docker-compose run --rm sh -c "python manage.py makemigrations"
```

**Key Points**

- **Image File Path Generation**: The `recipe_image_file_path` function uses UUIDs to generate a unique file path for 
each image, preventing filename conflicts.
- **Testing Path Generation**: The test mocks the UUID generation to check if the function creates the correct file path.
- **Updating Recipe Model**: By adding an ImageField to the Recipe model and specifying
`recipe_image_file_path` for `upload_to`, you're enabling image uploads for recipes.
- **Migrations**: Running migrations updates the database schema to include the new image field in the Recipe model.

With these changes, your Recipe model now supports image uploads, a crucial step in enhancing the functionality
of your recipe management application. This allows users to add visual elements to their recipes, making the
application more engaging and user-friendly.

## Step 4. Writing Tests for Uploading Images

To ensure that your Recipe Image API works correctly, writing tests for image upload functionality is essential.
These tests will verify that images can be uploaded to recipes and handle cases where the upload is invalid.

**Test for Uploading an Image**

This test checks if an image can be successfully uploaded to a recipe and verifies if the image is saved correctly.

```python
#recipe/tests/test_recipe_api.py

import tempfile
import os

from PIL import Image

def image_upload_url(recipe_id):
    """Create and return a recipe detail URL."""
    return reverse('recipe:recipe-upload-image', args=[recipe_id])

class ImageUploadTests(TestCase):
    """Tests for the image upload API."""

    def setUp(self):
        self.client = APIClient()
        self.user = create_user(
            email='user@example.com',
            password='password123'
        )
        self.client.force_authenticate(self.user)
        self.recipe = create_recipe(user=self.user)

    def tearDown(self):
        self.recipe.image.delete()

    def test_upload_image(self):
        """Test uploading an image to a recipe."""
        url = image_upload_url(self.recipe.id)
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.jpg') as image_file:
            img = Image.new('RGB', (10, 10))
            img.save(image_file, format='JPEG')
            image_file.seek(0)
            payload = {'image': image_file}
            res = self.client.post(url, payload, format='multipart')

        self.recipe.refresh_from_db()
        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        self.assertIn('image', res.data)
        self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(self.recipe.image.path))
```
**Test for Uploading an Invalid Image**

This test ensures that the API handles invalid image uploads correctly by returning a 400 Bad Request response.

```python
    def test_upload_image_bad_request(self):
        """Test uploading invalid image."""
        url = image_upload_url(self.recipe.id)
        payload = {'image': 'notanimage'}
        res = self.client.post(url, payload, format='multipart')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

**Key Points**

- **Temporary Image File**: The `test_upload_image` test creates a temporary image file using Python's `tempfile` and
`PIL` libraries. This image is then uploaded to the server.
- **Testing Image Upload**: The test verifies that the image upload increases the count of images, returns a success
status code, and the path of the uploaded image exists.
- **Invalid Image Test**: The `test_upload_image_bad_request` checks that the API returns a 400 status code when an 
invalid image is uploaded.

With these tests, you can ensure that your image uploading functionality works as intended and is robust enough to 
handle both valid and invalid requests. Remember to implement the corresponding API view to handle image uploads and 
run these tests to confirm everything is functioning correctly.

## Step 5. Implementing the Image API

You're now ready to implement the image uploading functionality in your Recipe API. This involves creating a serializer
for handling image data and adding an action to your RecipeViewSet to manage image uploads.

**Recipe Image Serializer**

First, create a **RecipeImageSerializer** in `app/recipe/serializers.py`. This serializer is specifically designed
for handling image uploads associated with recipes.
```python
#app/recipe/serializers.py

class RecipeImageSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """Serializer for uploading images to recipes."""

    class Meta:
        model = Recipe
        fields = ['id', 'image']
        read_only = ['id']
        extra_kwargs = {'image': {'required': 'True'}}

```

**Updating the Recipe ViewSet**

Next, update the **RecipeViewSet** in `app/recipe/views.py` to include the image upload functionality.
You will add a custom action to handle POST requests for image uploads.

```python
#app/recipe/views.py

from rest_framework.response import Response

class RecipeViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    # Existing configurations...

    def get_serializer_class(self):
        """Return the serializer class for request."""
        if self.action == 'list':
            return serializers.RecipeSerializer
        elif self.action == 'upload_image':
            return serializers.RecipeImageSerializer

        return self.serializer_class

    @action(methods=['POST'], detail=True, url_path='upload-image')
    def upload_image(self, request, pk=None):
        """Upload an image to recipe."""
        recipe = self.get_object()
        serializer = self.get_serializer(recipe, data=request.data)

        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

**Updating Settings for Swagger Documentation**

Finally, if you're using `drf-spectacular` for Swagger documentation, you might need to adjust **SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS**
in **settings.py** to split request components correctly.

```python
# settings.py

SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS = {
    'COMPONENT_SPLIT_REQUEST': True,
}

```

**Key Points**

- **RecipeImageSerializer**: Manages the serialization and validation of image data.
- **Custom Action in RecipeViewSet**: The `upload_image` method handles the logic for uploading images. It uses 
the **RecipeImageSerializer** to validate the uploaded image.
- **Swagger Documentation Settings**: The `COMPONENT_SPLIT_REQUEST` setting in `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS` helps handle
documentation for APIs with different request methods properly.

With these implementations, your Recipe API now supports image uploading, significantly enhancing its functionality.
Users can now attach images to their recipes, making the application more interactive and visually appealing.
Be sure to test this feature thoroughly to ensure it works smoothly.
