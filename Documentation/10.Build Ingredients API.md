# 10. Build Ingredients API
After successfully implementing a Tags API, the next step in enhancing your recipe management application is to build
an Ingredients API. This API will focus on managing ingredients associated with recipes, similar to how tags 
were handled. The goal is to allow users to add, update, and manage various ingredients that make up their recipes.

___
## Step 1. Add ingredient model

In core/tests/test_models.py, you'll add a test to ensure that the creation of an ingredient works as expected.

```python
#core/tests/test_model.py
class ModelTests(TestCase):
    """Test models."""
    
    # Other tests...
    
    def test_create_ingredient(self):
        """Test creating an ingredient is successful."""
        user = create_user()
        ingredient = models.Ingredient.objects.create(
            user=user,
            name='Ingredient1',
        )

        self.assertEqual(str(ingredient), ingredient.name)
```

**Implement the Ingredient Model**

In `**core/models.py**`, you'll define the `Ingredient` model and update the `**Recipe**` model to include a
many-to-many relationship with **`Ingredient`**.
```python
#core/models.py
class Recipe(models.Model):
    """Recipe object."""
    
    # Other fields...
    tags = models.ManyToManyField('Tag')
    ingredients = models.ManyToManyField('Ingredient')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

class Ingredient(models.Model):
    """Ingredient for recipes."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    user = models.ForeignKey(
        settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    )

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
**Create Database Migrations**
Run the migrations to update your database schema with the new Ingredient model:
```commandline
docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py makemigrations"

...
core/migrations/0004_auto_20230924_1234.py
    - Create model Ingredient
    - Add field Ingredients to recipe
```

**Register Ingredient in Admin**

In `**core/admin.py**`, register the `**Ingredient**` model to manage it via the Django admin interface.
```python
#core/admin.py

# Other model registrations...
admin.site.register(models.Ingredient)
```

**Notes and Considerations**

- Ensure that the **`Ingredient`** model has a foreign key to the user to allow for user-specific ingredients.
- The test for creating an ingredient verifies that the model is correctly set up and can be instantiated
and saved to the database.
- By adding ingredients as a many-to-many field in the **`Recipe`** model, you're allowing each recipe to 
have multiple ingredients, and each ingredient can be part of multiple recipes.
- After making these changes, run your tests to ensure that everything is working as expected.

With these steps, you've successfully laid the groundwork for the Ingredients API, allowing for the creation and 
management of ingredients in recipes.

## Step 2. Writing Tests for Listing Ingredients

In building your Ingredients API, writing tests for listing ingredients is a crucial step. 
It ensures that your API can correctly retrieve a list of ingredients and that it adheres to authentication
rules and user-specific data access. Here’s a breakdown of the tests you’ve outlined in `test_ingredients_api.py`:

**Test for Public (Unauthenticated) API Access**

This test verifies that authentication is required to access the ingredients list.
```python
# recipe/tests/test_ingredients_api

from decimal import Decimal
from django.test import TestCase
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.urls import reverse

from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.test import APIClient

from core.models import (
    Ingredient,
    Recipe,
)
from recipe.serializers import IngredientSerializer

INGREDIENTS_URL = reverse('recipe:ingredient-list')

def create_user(email='user@example.com', password='testpass123'):
    """Create and return user."""
    return get_user_model().objects.create_user(email=email, password=password)

class PublicIngredientApiTest(TestCase):
    """Test unauthenticated API requests."""

    def setUp(self):
        self.client = APIClient()

    def test_auth_required(self):
        """Test auth is required for retrieving ingredients."""
        res = self.client.get(INGREDIENTS_URL)

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED)
```
**Test for Private (Authenticated) API Access**

These tests ensure that authenticated users can retrieve a list of ingredients and that they only see their own
ingredients.
```python
class PrivateIngredientsApiTests(TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.user = create_user()
        self.client = APIClient()
        self.client.force_authenticate(self.user)

    def test_retrieve_ingredients(self):
        """Test retrieving a list of ingredients."""
        Ingredient.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Kale')
        Ingredient.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Vanilla')

        res = self.client.get(INGREDIENTS_URL)

        ingredients = Ingredient.objects.all().order_by('-name')
        serializer = IngredientSerializer(ingredients, many=True)

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        self.assertEqual(res.data, serializer.data)

    def test_ingredients_limited_to_user(self):
        """Test list of ingredients is limited to authenticated user."""
        user2 = create_user(email='user2@example.com')
        Ingredient.objects.create(user=user2, name='Salt')
        ingredient = Ingredient.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Proper')

        res = self.client.get(INGREDIENTS_URL)

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        self.assertEqual(len(res.data), 1)
        self.assertEqual(res.data[0]['name'], ingredient.name)
        self.assertEqual(res.data[0]['id'], ingredient.id)
```

**Key Points**

- The `**test_auth_required**` method in `**PublicIngredientApiTest**` checks if the endpoint is properly secured 
against unauthenticated access.
- The `**test_retrieve_ingredients**` method in `**PrivateIngredientsApiTests**` checks if authenticated users can
retrieve all their ingredients.
- The `**test_ingredients_limited_to_user**` method ensures that users can only access their own ingredients, not those
of other users.

By implementing these tests, you ensure that your Ingredients API behaves correctly, both in terms of data
retrieval and access control. This is essential for maintaining the integrity and privacy of user data in
your application. Make sure to run these tests after implementing the corresponding API functionalities to
confirm everything works as expected.

## Step 3. Implement ingredient listing API

our implementation for the Ingredient Listing API is well-organized and follows good software development
practices by using a base viewset class. Here's how each part of your implementation works:

**Ingredient Serializer in recipe/serializers.py**

You define `**IngredientSerializer**` to handle the serialization and deserialization of ingredient data. This serializer
will convert ingredient instances to and from JSON format for API requests and responses.

```python
# recipe/serializers.py

from core.models import (
    Recipe,
    Tag,
    Ingredient,
)

# Other classes ...

class IngredientSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """Serializer for ingredients."""

    class Meta:
        model = Ingredient
        fields = ['id', 'name']
        read_only_fields = ['id']
```

**Base ViewSet for Recipe Attributes in recipe/views.py**

You create a base viewset, `**BaseRecipeAttrViewSet**`, which other viewsets like `**IngredientViewSet**` can inherit 
from. This base class includes common configurations like authentication and permission classes, and a method
for filtering the queryset to the authenticated user.

```python
# recipe/views.py

# Other classes ...

class BaseRecipeAttrViewSet(mixins.ListModelMixin,
                            viewsets.GenericViewSet):
    """Base viewset for recipe attributes."""
    authentication_classes = [TokenAuthentication]
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
    
    def get_queryset(self):
        """Filter queryset to authenticated user."""
        return self.queryset.filter(user=self.request.user).order_by('-name')

class IngredientViewSet(BaseRecipeAttrViewSet):
    """Manage ingredients in the database."""
    serializer_class = serializers.IngredientSerializer
    queryset = Ingredient.objects.all()
```

**URL Configuration in recipe/urls.py**

You update the URL configuration to include the IngredientViewSet, allowing API requests for ingredient data.

```python
#recipe/urls.py

# Other routes...
router.register('ingredients', views.IngredientViewSet)
```

**Key Points**

- The `**IngredientSerializer**` handles the data conversion for ingredient objects.
- Using a base viewset (`**BaseRecipeAttrViewSet**`) for common attributes and methods is an efficient approach
to avoid code duplication.
- The `**IngredientViewSet**` inherits from `**BaseRecipeAttrViewSet**`, getting all the configurations
and methods, and only needs to specify the `**serializer_class**` and **`queryset`**.
- Your URL configuration in `**recipe/urls.py**` correctly sets up the route for accessing ingredient data.

With this setup, your Ingredient Listing API should work effectively, providing authenticated users the ability to 
retrieve their own list of ingredients. Remember to test this implementation to ensure everything is working as 
intended.

## Step 4. Write tests for updating ingredients

You are correctly setting up tests for updating ingredients in your Ingredients API. These tests are essential for
ensuring that your API supports updating ingredient details. Let's review the test case you've outlined:

**Test for Updating an Ingredient**

This test verifies the functionality of updating an existing ingredient's name through a PATCH request.

```python
#recipe/tests/test_ingredients_api.py

# Other imports...

def detail_url(ingredient_id):
    """Create and return an ingredient detail URL."""
    return reverse('recipe:ingredient-detail', args=[ingredient_id])

class PrivateIngredientsApiTests(TestCase):

    # Other tests...

    def test_update_ingredient(self):
        """Test updating an ingredient."""
        ingredient = Ingredient.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Cilantro')

        payload = {'name': 'Coriander'}
        url = detail_url(ingredient.id)
        res = self.client.patch(url, payload)

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        ingredient.refresh_from_db()
        self.assertEqual(ingredient.name, payload['name'])
    
```

**Key Points**

- The `**detail_url**` function generates the URL for a specific ingredient's detail view.
Ensure the URL name `**recipe:ingredient-detail**` matches the one defined in your URL configurations.
- The `**test_update_ingredient**` method checks if an ingredient can be updated successfully.
It creates an ingredient, updates its name, and verifies if the update was reflected in the database.
- The use of **`patch`** method in the test case indicates a partial update, which is typical for updating
a single or a few fields in an API resource.

With this test, you'll be able to confirm that your Ingredients API allows authenticated users to update existing
ingredients. After implementing the corresponding update functionality in your API view, running this test will
help ensure that everything works as expected.

## Step 5. Implementing Update Ingredient API

To enable the update functionality in your Ingredients API, you've made a great decision to extend
the **`BaseRecipeAttrViewSet`** with **`mixins.UpdateModelMixin`**. This mixin provides the necessary actions to
handle update (PUT and PATCH) requests. Here's how your updated **`BaseRecipeAttrViewSet`** will look in **views.py:**

```python
class BaseRecipeAttrViewSet(mixins.UpdateModelMixin,
                            mixins.ListModelMixin,
                            viewsets.GenericViewSet):
    """Base viewset for recipe attributes."""
    authentication_classes = [TokenAuthentication]
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
```

**Key Points**

- The **`BaseRecipeAttrViewSet`** now includes **`mixins.UpdateModelMixin`**, which provides the necessary functionality
to update ingredient instances.
- The **`IngredientViewSet`** inherits from **`BaseRecipeAttrViewSet`**, receiving both list and update capabilities.
- The **`get_queryset`** method ensures that users only access and modify their own ingredients, maintaining data
privacy and integrity.
- Authentication and permission classes are specified to ensure that only authenticated users can access
and modify the ingredient data.

With this implementation, your API now supports updating ingredients, allowing users to modify existing
ingredient details. Remember to test this new functionality with the test cases you've written to ensure
that it behaves as expected and maintains the necessary security constraints.

## Step 6. Write tests for deleting ingredients
Your test for deleting ingredients is a key component in ensuring the robustness of your Ingredients API.
This test verifies that ingredients can be successfully removed from the database, and it's essential for 
maintaining the integrity and accuracy of your application's data. Here's a closer look at the test case you've
outlined:

**Test for Deleting an Ingredient**

This test checks whether an authenticated user can delete an ingredient and verifies that the ingredient is
indeed removed from the database.
```python
#recipe/tests/test_ingredients_api.py

# Other imports...

class PrivateIngredientsApiTests(TestCase):

    # Other tests...

    def test_delete_ingredient(self):
        """Test deleting ingredient."""
        ingredient = Ingredient.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Lettuce')
        url = detail_url(ingredient.id)
        res = self.client.delete(url)

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
        ingredients = Ingredient.objects.filter(user=self.user)
        self.assertFalse(ingredients.exists())
```

**Key Points**

- The detail_url function generates the URL for a specific ingredient's detail view. Ensure that the
URL name recipe:ingredient-detail matches the one defined in your URL configurations.
- The test_delete_ingredient method tests the deletion functionality by making a DELETE request to the ingredient's
detail URL and then verifying that the ingredient no longer exists in the database.
- This test ensures that your API correctly handles deletion requests and maintains data integrity by removing the
specified ingredient.


By implementing and running this test, you can confirm that your Ingredients API allows authenticated users to
delete ingredients. This functionality is crucial for users who need to manage or correct their ingredient
lists. After adding the corresponding delete functionality in your API view, make sure to test this feature
to ensure it's working as intended.

## Step 7. Implement delete ingredients API

Enhancing the **`BaseRecipeAttrViewSet`** with **`mixins.DestroyModelMixin`** is an excellent way to implement the
delete functionality for ingredients in your Ingredients API. This mixin provides the necessary support to
handle DELETE requests, enabling the deletion of ingredient instances.

**Updated BaseRecipeAttrViewSet in recipe/views.py**

```python
class BaseRecipeAttrViewSet(mixins.UpdateModelMixin,
                            mixins.DestroyModelMixin,  # <- Update this mixins
                            mixins.ListModelMixin,
                            viewsets.GenericViewSet):
    """Base viewset for recipe attributes."""
    authentication_classes = [TokenAuthentication]
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
```

**Key Points**

- The **`BaseRecipeAttrViewSet`** now includes **`mixins.`****`DestroyModelMixin`** along with **`UpdateModelMixin`** 
and **`ListModelMixin`**, providing a full range of CRUD (Create, Read, Update,Delete) operations for recipe attributes.
- The **`IngredientViewSet`** inherits from **`BaseRecipeAttrViewSet`**, which means it automatically gets the
functionality to handle list, update, and delete operations.
- The **`get_queryset`** method ensures that users only interact with their own ingredients, maintaining data privacy
and integrity.
- Authentication (**`TokenAuthentication`**) and permission (**`IsAuthenticated`**) classes are specified to
ensure that only authenticated users can interact with ingredient data.

With this implementation, your API now supports the deletion of ingredients, allowing users to manage their 
ingredient lists effectively. This is a critical functionality for users who need to update or clean up their lists.
Make sure to test this new feature to confirm that it works as expected and adheres to your application's security and
data integrity standards.

## Step 8. Writing Tests for Creating Recipes with Ingredients

The tests you've written for creating recipes with new and existing ingredients are crucial for ensuring that your API
correctly handles ingredient data. These tests check whether your API can handle the addition of ingredients to
recipes during the recipe creation process. Let's break down these tests:

**Test for Creating a Recipe with New Ingredients**

This test verifies if a recipe can be created with new ingredients. It sends a payload containing a recipe and new 
ingredient names, then checks if the recipe and ingredients are correctly created and associated.

```python
#recipe/tests/test_recipe_api

# Other imports...

class PrivateRecipeApiTests(TestCase):
    """Test authenticated API requests."""
    
    # Other tests...
    
    def test_create_recipe_with_new_ingredients(self):
        """Test creating a recipe with new ingredients."""
        payload = {
            'title': 'Cauliflower Tacos',
            'time_minutes': 60,
            'price': Decimal('4.30'),
            'ingredients': [{'name': 'Cauliflower'}, {'name': 'Salt'}],
        }
        res = self.client.post(RECIPES_URL, payload, format='json')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        recipes = Recipe.objects.filter(user=self.user)
        self.assertEqual(recipes.count(), 1)
        recipe = recipes[0]
        self.assertEqual(recipe.ingredients.count(), 2)
        for ingredient in payload['ingredients']:
            exists = recipe.ingredients.filter(
                name=ingredient['name'],
                user=self.user,
            ).exists()
            self.assertTrue(exists)
```
**Test for Creating a Recipe with Existing Ingredient**

This test checks if a recipe can be created using existing ingredients. It ensures that the API doesn't create duplicate
ingredients and correctly associates them with the recipe.
```python
    def test_create_recipe_with_existing_ingredient(self):
        """Test creating a new recipe with existing ingredient."""
        ingredient = Ingredient.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Lemon')
        payload = {
            'title': 'Vietnamese Soup',
            'time_minutes': 25,
            'price': Decimal('2.55'),
            'ingredients': [{'name': 'Lemon'}, {'name': 'Fish Sauce'}],
        }
        res = self.client.post(RECIPES_URL, payload, format='json')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        recipes = Recipe.objects.filter(user=self.user)
        self.assertEqual(recipes.count(), 1)
        recipe = recipes[0]
        self.assertEqual(recipe.ingredients.count(), 2)
        self.assertIn(ingredient, recipe.ingredients.all())
        for ingredient in payload['ingredients']:
            exists = recipe.ingredients.filter(
                name=ingredient['name'],
                user=self.user,
            ).exists()
            self.assertTrue(exists)
```

**Key Points**

- Ensure that **`RECIPES_URL`** is correctly defined, pointing to your recipe creation endpoint.
- The **`format='json'`** parameter in the `post` method call ensures that the request payload is correctly handled as 
JSON.
- These tests will validate whether your API can handle the creation of recipes with both new and existing ingredients,
which is a fundamental part of ingredient management in recipes.

By implementing these tests, you will ensure that your API behaves correctly when handling recipes with ingredients,
thereby maintaining the integrity and functionality of your recipe management system. Remember to run these tests after
implementing the corresponding API functionalities to confirm that everything is working as expected.

## Step 9. Implementing Create Ingredients Feature

Your implementation in **`recipe/serializers.py`** effectively adds the functionality to create and associate 
ingredients with recipes during the recipe creation process. You've successfully incorporated the handling
of both tags and ingredients into the **`RecipeSerializer`**. Here's a review of your implementation:

**Updated `RecipeSerializer` in `recipe/serializers.py`**

```python
# recipe/serializers.py

# Other imports 

# Other classes


class RecipeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """Serializer for recipes."""
    tags = TagSerializer(many=True, required=False)
    ingredients = IngredientSerializer(many=True, required=False)

    class Meta:
        model = Recipe
        fields = [
            'id', 'title', 'time_minutes', 'price', 'link', 'tags',
            'ingredients',
        ]
        read_only_fields = ['id']

    # Other methods

    def _get_or_create_ingredients(self, ingredients, recipe):
        """Handle getting or creating ingredients as needed."""
        auth_user = self.context['request'].user
        for ingredient in ingredients:
            ingredient_obj, created = Ingredient.objects.get_or_create(
                user=auth_user,
                **ingredient,
            )
            recipe.ingredients.add(ingredient_obj)

    def create(self, validated_data):
        """Create a recipe."""
        tags = validated_data.pop('tags', [])
        ingredients = validated_data.pop('ingredients', [])
        recipe = Recipe.objects.create(**validated_data)
        self._get_or_create_tags(tags, recipe)
        self._get_or_create_ingredients(ingredients, recipe)
        return recipe
```

**Key Points and Suggestions**

- The **`tags`** and **`ingredients`** fields are correctly set up to handle lists of tags and ingredients, using their 
respective serializers for each item in the lists.
- The **`_get_or_create_ingredients`** method is an efficient way to either fetch existing ingredients or create new ones
and then associate them with the recipe.
- This method uses **`get_or_create`** to avoid creating duplicate ingredients for the same user and adds these
ingredients to the recipe.
- The **`create`** method is responsible for handling the creation of a recipe and its associated tags and ingredients.
It correctly extracts tags and ingredients data from `**validated_data**`, creates a recipe instance, and then 
associates the tags and ingredients with it.

## Step 10. Write tests for updating recipe ingredients feature

You have outlined comprehensive tests for the feature of updating recipe ingredients in your API. 
These tests are crucial for ensuring the correct functionality of adding, reassigning, and clearing ingredients in
a recipe. Let's examine each of these tests:

**Test for Creating an Ingredient on Recipe Update**

This test verifies whether a new ingredient can be added to a recipe during an update operation.

```python
#recipe/tests/test_recipe_api

# Other imports...

class PrivateRecipeApiTests(TestCase):
    """Test authenticated API requests."""
    
    # Other tests...
    
    def test_create_ingredient_on_update(self):
        """Test creating an ingredient when updating a recipe."""
        recipe = create_recipe(user=self.user)

        payload = {'ingredients': [{'name': 'Limes'}]}
        url = detail_url(recipe.id)
        res = self.client.patch(url, payload, format='json')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        new_ingredient = Ingredient.objects.get(user=self.user, name='Limes')
        self.assertIn(new_ingredient, recipe.ingredients.all())
```

**Test for Assigning an Existing Ingredient on Recipe Update**

This test checks if an existing ingredient can be assigned to a recipe during an update, and verifies that previously
assigned ingredients are replaced.

```python
    def test_update_recipe_assign_ingredient(self):
        """Test assigning an existing ingredient when updating a recipe."""
        ingredient1 = Ingredient.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Pepper')
        recipe = create_recipe(user=self.user)
        recipe.ingredients.add(ingredient1)

        ingredient2 = Ingredient.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Chili')
        payload = {'ingredients': [{'name': 'Chili'}]}
        url = detail_url(recipe.id)
        res = self.client.patch(url, payload, format='json')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        self.assertIn(ingredient2, recipe.ingredients.all())
        self.assertNotIn(ingredient1, recipe.ingredients.all())
```
**Test for Clearing Recipe Ingredients**

This test ensures that all ingredients can be removed from a recipe.
```python
    def test_clear_recipe_ingredients(self):
        """Test clearing a recipes ingredients."""
        ingredient = Ingredient.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Garlic')
        recipe = create_recipe(user=self.user)
        recipe.ingredients.add(ingredient)

        payload = {'ingredients': []}
        url = detail_url(recipe.id)
        res = self.client.patch(url, payload, format='json')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        self.assertEqual(recipe.ingredients.count(), 0)
    
```

**Key Points**

- Ensure the **`detail_url`** function generates the correct URL for a recipe's detail view.
- The tests comprehensively cover the scenarios of adding new ingredients, reassigning existing ingredients, and
clearing all ingredients from a recipe.
- Using **`format='json'`** in the `**patch**` and `**post**` requests ensures that the data is sent in JSON format.

These tests will help validate that your API correctly handles the updating of ingredients in recipes, which
is an essential aspect of recipe management. After implementing the corresponding update functionality in your API,
run these tests to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Step 11. Implementing Update Recipe Ingredients Feature

Your implementation in `**recipe/serializers.py**` effectively adds the functionality to update a recipe's tags and
ingredients. This approach ensures that the recipe can be updated with new sets of tags and ingredients, thereby
enhancing the flexibility of your recipe management system. Here's a review of your implementation:

**Updated RecipeSerializer in recipe/serializers.py**
```python

**Key Points and Suggestions**

- Handling Tags and Ingredients: The update method now handles both tags and ingredients. It clears the existing tags
and ingredients and then adds the new ones provided in the request.
- Flexibility: This implementation allows for a high degree of flexibility. Users can completely change the tags
and ingredients associated with a recipe.
- Data Integrity: Clearing and re-adding tags and ingredients might be a heavy operation in terms of database queries.
It's an effective approach but ensure that it aligns with your application's performance requirements.
- Error Handling: Make sure to handle potential errors or edge cases, such as invalid tag or ingredient data.

With this implementation, your API now supports comprehensive updating of recipes, including their associated tags
and ingredients. This feature significantly enhances the usability and flexibility of your recipe management system.
