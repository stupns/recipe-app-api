# 9. Build Tags API
It appears you're progressing to build a Tags API, which likely involves associating tags with recipes. However,
the provided test code focuses on the creation of a recipe rather than anything specific to tags. If you're planning
to introduce tags, you'll need tests that also handle the creation and association of tags with recipes.

___
## Step 1. Write test for recipe model

In core/tests/test_models.py, you should add a test to ensure that the creation of a tag works as expected. This test 
will validate the basic functionality of the Tag model.

In `core\tests\test_models`:

```python
# core\tests\test_models.py

def create_user(email='user@example.com', password='testpass123'):
    """Create and return a new user."""
    return get_user_model().objects.create_user(email, password)

class ModelTests(TestCase):
    """Test models."""

    # Other tests...

    def test_create_tag(self):
        """Test creating a tag is successful."""
        user = create_user()
        tag = models.Tag.objects.create(user=user, name='Tag1')

        self.assertEqual(str(tag), tag.name)
```

**Implementing Tag and Recipe Models**

In `core/models.py`
Modify your **`Recipe`** and **`Tag`** models to establish their relationship. A many-to-many relationship
(`**ManyToManyField**`) is appropriate if a recipe can have multiple tags and a tag can be associated with multiple
recipes.

```python
#core\models.py

class Recipe(models.Model):
    """Recipe object."""
    # Others fields ...
    tags = models.ManyToManyField('Tag')


class Tag(models.Model):
    """Tag for filtering recipes."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    user = models.ForeignKey(
        settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    )

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
**Database Migrations**

Run the following command to create migrations for your new models:
```commandline
docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py makemigrations"
```

**Registering Tag in Admin**

In `core/admin.py`, register the **Tag** model to manage it via the Django admin interface.

```python
# core\admin.py

# Other model registrations...
admin.site.register(models.Tag)
```

**Next Steps**

- After implementing these changes, you should run your tests to ensure the Tag model works as expected.
- You may also want to create tests for associating tags with recipes and filtering recipes by tags, which are likely
key features of your Tags API.
- Ensure that your API views and serializers are updated to handle tags appropriately, including creating, listing,
updating, and deleting tags.

By following these steps, you will lay a solid foundation for your Tags API, ensuring that it integrates well with
your existing Recipe model and meets the functional requirements of your application.

## Step 2. Write tests for listing tags

You've outlined a detailed approach for testing the functionality of listing tags in your Tags API. Your tests will
ensure that only authenticated users can retrieve a list of tags and that users can only access their own tags. Here's
an overview of your test cases in test_tags_api.py:

**PublicTagsApiTests**

These tests are designed to validate that authentication is required for accessing the tags API.
```python
# recipe\tests\test_tags_api.py

"""
Tests for the tags API.
"""
from decimal import Decimal
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.urls import reverse
from django.test import TestCase

from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.test import APIClient

from core.models import (
    Tag,
    Recipe,
)
from recipe.serializers import TagSerializer

TAGS_URL = reverse('recipe:tag-list')

def create_user(email='user@example.com', password='testpass123'):
    """Create and return a new user."""
    return get_user_model().objects.create_user(email=email, password=password)

class PublicTagsApiTests(TestCase):
    """Test authenticated API requests."""

    def setUp(self):
        self.client = APIClient()

    def test_auth_required(self):
        """Test auth is required for retrieving tags."""
        res = self.client.get(TAGS_URL)

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED)
```

**PrivateTagsApiTests**

These tests check the functionality for authenticated requests, ensuring that tags are correctly retrieved and are
limited to those created by the authenticated user.
```python

class PrivateTagsApiTests(TestCase):
    """Test authenticated API requests."""

    def setUp(self):
        self.user = create_user()
        self.client = APIClient()
        self.client.force_authenticate(self.user)

    def test_retrieve_tags(self):
        """Test retrieving a list of tags."""
        Tag.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Vegan')
        Tag.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Dessert')

        res = self.client.get(TAGS_URL)

        tags = Tag.objects.all().order_by('-name')
        serializer = TagSerializer(tags, many=True)
        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        self.assertEqual(res.data, serializer.data)

    def test_tags_limited_to_user(self):
        """Test list of tags is limited to authenticated user."""
        user2 = create_user(email='user2@example.com')
        Tag.objects.create(user=user2, name='Fruity')
        tag = Tag.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Comfort Food')

        res = self.client.get(TAGS_URL)

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        self.assertEqual(len(res.data), 1)
        self.assertEqual(res.data[0]['name'], tag.name)
        self.assertEqual(res.data[0]['id'], tag.id)
```

**Key Points**

- Ensure you have the `**TagSerializer**` implemented in your recipe/serializers.py file.
- The **`TAGS_URL`** should correctly point to your tags listing endpoint. Ensure it matches the URL name defined
in your URL configurations.
- The test `**test_tags_limited_to_user**` is crucial for verifying that users can only access their own tags,
enhancing the security and integrity of your API.

With these tests in place, you'll be able to validate that your Tags API behaves as expected in both authenticated and
unauthenticated contexts, ensuring that it handles tag listings correctly. Make sure to run these tests after
implementing the corresponding API views and serializers to confirm that everything is working as intended.

## Step 3. Implement tag listening API

ou're on the right track with implementing your Tag Listing API.
Here's a breakdown of the changes you'll make in your Django project.

**Create `TagSerializer` in `recipe/serializers.py`**

You'll start by defining a **TagSerializer** to handle the serialization of tag data.
This serializer will convert tag instances to and from JSON format.

```python
#recipe\serializers.py

# Others classes...
from core.models import (
    Recipe,
    Tag,
)

class TagSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """Serializer for tags."""

    class Meta:
        model = Tag
        fields = ['id', 'name']
        read_only_fields = ['id']
```

**Define `TagViewSet` in `recipe/views.py`**

Next, create a **TagViewSet** to handle requests related to tags.
Since you're initially implementing tag listing functionality, you'll use **ListModelMixin** and **GenericViewSet**.

```python
# recipe\views.py

from rest_framework import (
    viewsets,
    mixins,
    status,
)

from core.models import (
    Recipe,
    Tag,
)

# Other classes ...

class TagViewSet(mixins.ListModelMixin, viewsets.GenericViewSet): # need later optimize
    """Manage tags in the database."""
    serializer_class = serializers.TagSerializer
    queryset = Tag.objects.all()
    authentication_classes = [TokenAuthentication]  # need later optimize
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get_queryset(self):
        """Retrieve queryset to authenticated user."""
        return  self.queryset.filter(user=self.request.user).order_by('-name')
```

**Update URL Configuration in `recipe/urls.py`**

Finally, add the **TagViewSet** to your URL router to create the endpoint for tags.

```python
# recipe\urls.py

# Other routes...
router.register('tags', views.TagViewSet)
```

**Notes and Considerations**

- The **TagViewSet** uses the **ListModelMixin** to provide listing functionality. As you expand your API,
you might add more mixins or change to **ModelViewSet** if you need full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
capabilities.
- The **get_queryset** method ensures that users will only see their own tags, aligning with the principle of
data ownership and privacy.
- Make sure your URL names and paths in `recipe/urls.py` are set up correctly to match your API's structure.

By following these steps, you'll establish the foundational aspects of your Tags API, allowing authenticated users
to view a list of their tags. This setup also sets the stage for further expansion of tag-related
functionalities in your API.

## Step 4. Write tests for updating tags.

Writing tests for updating tags is an important step in ensuring that your Tags API functions correctly. Let's go
through the test you've outlined for updating a tag:

**Test for Updating a Tag**

This test checks whether a tag can be successfully updated using a PATCH request.
It creates a tag, updates it with a new name, and then checks if the update was successful.

```python
#tests\test_tags_api.py

# Other imports and test cases...
# Others methods...

def detail_url(tag_id):
    """Create and return a tag detail url."""
    return reverse('recipe:tag-detail', args=[tag_id])

class PrivateTagsApiTests(TestCase):
    """Test authenticated API requests."""
    
    # Other test methods...
    
    def test_update_tag(self):
        """Test updating a tag."""
        tag = Tag.objects.create(user=self.user, name='After Dinner')

        payload = {'name': 'Dessert'}
        url = detail_url(tag.id)
        res = self.client.patch(url, payload)

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        tag.refresh_from_db()
        self.assertEqual(tag.name, payload['name'])

```

**Key Points**

- The `**detail_url**` function generates the URL for a specific tag's detail view. Ensure the URL name 
`**recipe:tag-detail**` matches the one defined in your URL configurations.
- In **PrivateTagsApiTests**, the setUp method prepares an authenticated client and a test user for the tests.
- **`test_update_tag`** checks the functionality of updating a tag's name. It creates a tag, sends a PATCH request
to update it, and then verifies if the update was applied correctly.

With this test, you'll be able to verify that your Tags API allows authenticated users to update their tags.
After implementing the corresponding view for handling PATCH requests in your Tags API, run these tests to
ensure everything is working as expected.

## Step 5. Implement Update Tag API

To enable the functionality of updating tags in your Tags API, you will modify the **`TagViewSet`** in 
`recipe/views.py`. By including **mixins.UpdateModelMixin**, you're allowing your API to handle PATCH and PUT requests
for updating tag instances.

Here's how you can update the `**TagViewSet**`:

```python
#recipe\views.py
                 
class TagViewSet(mixins.UpdateModelMixin,
                 mixins.ListModelMixin,
                 viewsets.GenericViewSet): # need later optimize
    """Manage tags in the database."""
    ...

```

**Key Points**

- By adding `**mixins.UpdateModelMixin**`, the **TagViewSet** now supports handling update requests. This mixin
provides the `**.update()**` and `**.partial_update()**` actions.
- The **`get_queryset`** method ensures that users only have access to their own tags, which is important for
maintaining user data isolation and security.
- Remember to keep your authentication and permission classes in place to ensure that only authenticated
users can access and modify tags.

With this implementation, your Tags API will now support updating tags, allowing users to
modify existing tags' details. After making these changes, be sure to test your API to ensure that the
update functionality is working correctly and securely.

## Step 6. Write tests for deleting tags

Test for deleting tags is a crucial part of ensuring the robustness of your Tags API. It verifies
that authenticated users can delete their tags and that the tags are indeed removed from the database.
Here's a breakdown of your test case:

**Test for Deleting a Tag**

This test ensures that an authenticated user can delete a tag and that the tag is no longer present
in the database after deletion.

```python
# recipe\tests\test_tags_api.py

# Other imports and test cases...

class PrivateTagsApiTests(TestCase):
    """Test authenticated API requests."""
    
    # Others test methods...
    
    def test_delete_tag(self):
        """Test deleting a tag."""
        tag = Tag.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Breakfast')

        url = detail_url(tag.id)
        res = self.client.delete(url)

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
        tags = Tag.objects.filter(user=self.user)
        self.assertFalse(tags.exists())
```

**Key Points**

- The `**detail_url**` function generates the URL for a specific tag's detail view. 
Ensure that the URL name `**recipe:tag-detail**` matches the one defined in your URL configurations.
- The **`test test_delete_tag`** creates a tag, deletes it, and then checks that the tag no longer exists in the
database. The status code HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT indicates successful deletion.
- This test ensures that the delete functionality of your Tags API is working as expected and that tags
are properly removed upon request.

After implementing the corresponding delete functionality in your API view, run this test to confirm that
tags can be deleted correctly by authenticated users. This will help maintain the integrity and 
cleanliness of the user's data in your application.

## Step 7. Implement delete tag API

To enable the deletion of tags in your Tags API, you'll need to update the **`TagViewSet`** in `recipe/views.py`.
Including `**mixins.DestroyModelMixin**` allows your API to handle DELETE requests, enabling users to delete tags.

Here's the updated **`TagViewSet`** implementation:

```python
#recipe\views.py
                 
class TagViewSet(mixins.DestroyModelMixin,
                 mixins.UpdateModelMixin,
                 mixins.ListModelMixin,
                 viewsets.GenericViewSet): # need later optimize
    """Manage tags in the database."""
    ...

```

**Key Points**

- By adding `**mixins.DestroyModelMixin**`, the **`TagViewSet`** now supports DELETE requests. This mixin provides
the `**.destroy()**` action which is invoked when a DELETE request is made.
- The existing **`ListModelMixin`** and **`UpdateModelMixin`** are retained to continue supporting
listing and updating tags.
- The **get_queryset** method is kept as is, ensuring that users can only interact with their own tags.
- Make sure that your authentication and permission classes (e.g., TokenAuthentication and IsAuthenticated)
are correctly set to protect your API endpoints.

With these changes, your Tags API will now support deleting tags, allowing users to manage their tags more
effectively. After making these updates, test your API to ensure that the delete functionality is working correctly
and that tags can be securely removed by authorized users.

## Step 8. Writing Tests for Creating Recipes with Tags

Writing tests for creating recipes with new and existing tags is a crucial step in ensuring the functionality of your
Tags API. Here's a breakdown of the test cases you've outlined:

**Test for Creating a Recipe with New Tags**

This test checks if a recipe can be created with new tags. It sends a payload with a recipe and new tag names,
then verifies if the recipe and tags are created correctly.

```python
#recipe/tests/test_recipe_api.py
from core.models import (
    Recipe,
    Tag,
)
# Other imports and test cases...

class PrivateRecipeApiTests(TestCase):
    """Test authenticated API requests."""
    
    # Others test methods...

    def test_create_recipe_with_new_tags(self):
        """Tst creating a recipe with new tags."""
        payload = {
            'title': 'Thai Prawn Curry',
            'time_minutes': 30,
            'price': Decimal('2.25'),
            'tags': [{'name': 'Thai'}, {'name': 'Dinner'}]
        }
        res = self.client.post(RECIPES_URL, payload, format='json')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        recipes = Recipe.objects.filter(user=self.user)
        self.assertEqual(recipes.count(), 1)
        recipe = recipes[0]
        self.assertEqual(recipe.tags.count(), 2)
        for tag in payload['tags']:
            exists = recipe.tags.filter(
                name=tag['name'],
                user=self.user,
            ).exists()
            self.assertTrue(exists)
```
**Test for Creating a Recipe with Existing Tags**

This test verifies if a recipe can be created using a combination of new and existing tags. It ensures that the API
doesn't create duplicate tags and correctly associates them with the recipe.
```python
    def test_create_with_existing_tags(self):
        """Test creating a recipe with existing tag."""
        tag_indian = Tag.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Indian')
        payload = {
            'title': 'Pongal',
            'time_minutes': 60,
            'price': Decimal('4.50'),
            'tags': [{'name': 'Indian'}, {'name': 'Breakfast'}]
        }
        res = self.client.post(RECIPES_URL, payload, format='json')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        recipes = Recipe.objects.filter(user=self.user)
        self.assertEqual(recipes.count(), 1)
        recipe = recipes[0]
        self.assertEqual(recipe.tags.count(), 2)
        self.assertIn(tag_indian, recipe.tags.all())
        for tag in payload['tags']:
            exists = recipe.tags.filter(
                name=tag['name'],
                user=self.user,
            ).exists()
            self.assertTrue(exists)
```
**Key Points**

- Ensure you have set up the `**RECIPE_URL**` correctly, pointing to the recipe creation endpoint.
- These tests will validate whether your API can handle the creation of recipes with both new and existing tags, which is
a fundamental part of recipe and tag management.
- The tests check both the creation of tags and their correct association with the created recipe.
- Remember to import `**Decimal**` and other necessary modules at the beginning of your test file.

By implementing these tests, you will ensure that your API behaves correctly when handling recipes with tags,
maintaining data integrity and providing the necessary functionality for recipe-tag management.

## Step 9. Implementing Create Tag Feature in Recipe Serializer

You're on the right track with your implementation of the create tag feature in the `**RecipeSerializer**`. This 
feature willallow users to create recipes and associate them with new or existing tags. Here's how your implementation
looks and some suggestions for potential optimizations:

```python
#recipe/serializers.py

class RecipeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """Serializer for recipes."""
    tags = TagSerializer(many=True, required=False)

    class Meta:
        model = Recipe
        fields = [
            'id', 'title', 'time_minutes', 'price', 'link', 'tags',
        ]
        read_only_fields = ['id']

    def create(self, validated_data):
        """Create a recipe."""
        tags = validated_data.pop('tags', [])
        recipe = Recipe.objects.create(**validated_data)
        #self._get_or_create_tags(tags, recipe) -> next optimize code
        auth_user = self.context['request'].user
        for tag in tags:
            tag_obj, created = Tag.objects.get_or_create(
                user=auth_user,
                **tag,
            )
            recipe.tags.add(tag_obj)
        return recipe
```

**Key Points and Suggestions**

- The `**tags**` field in `**RecipeSerializer**` is set up to handle a list of tags. It uses the `**TagSerializer**` for each tag
in the list.
- In the `**create**` method, tags are extracted from `**validated_data**`, and for each tag, you're either getting an
existing tag or creating a new one, associated with the recipe's user.
- The `**get_or_create**` method helps to avoid creating duplicate tags for the same user.
- The `**recipe.tags.add(tag_obj)**` method is used to associate the tag with the recipe.

With these implementations, your API will support creating recipes with new or existing tags, enhancing the
functionality and user experience of your recipe management system.

## Step 10. Writing Tests for Updating Recipe Tags

**Test for Creating a Tag on Recipe Update**
This test ensures that a new tag can be added to a recipe during an update operation.

```python
#recipe/tests/test_recipe_api.py

# Other imports and test cases...

class PrivateRecipeApiTests(TestCase):
    """Test authenticated API requests."""
    
    # Others test methods...

    def test_create_tag_on_update(self):
        """Test creating tag when updating a recipe."""
        recipe = create_recipe(user=self.user)

        payload = {'tags': [{'name': 'Lunch'}]}
        url = detail_url(recipe.id)
        res = self.client.patch(url, payload, format='json')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        new_tag = Tag.objects.get(user=self.user, name='Lunch')
        self.assertIn(new_tag, recipe.tags.all())
```
**Test for Assigning an Existing Tag on Recipe Update**

This test verifies that an existing tag can be assigned to a recipe, and ensures that previously assigned tags are
replaced.
```python
     
    def test_update_recipe_assign_tag(self):
        """Test assigning an existing tag when updating a recipe."""
        tag_breakfast = Tag.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Breakfast')
        recipe = create_recipe(user=self.user)
        recipe.tags.add(tag_breakfast)

        tag_lunch = Tag.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Lunch')
        payload = {'tags': [{'name': 'Lunch'}]}
        url = detail_url(recipe.id)
        res = self.client.patch(url, payload, format='json')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        self.assertIn(tag_lunch, recipe.tags.all())
        self.assertNotIn(tag_breakfast, recipe.tags.all())
```
**Test for Clearing Recipe Tags**

This test checks if the tags of a recipe can be completely cleared.
```python

    def test_clear_recipe_tags(self):
        """Test clearing a recipes tags."""
        tag = Tag.objects.create(user=self.user, name='Desert')
        recipe = create_recipe(user=self.user)
        recipe.tags.add(tag)

        payload = {'tags': []}
        url = detail_url(recipe.id)
        res = self.client.patch(url, payload, format='json')

        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        self.assertEqual(recipe.tags.count(), 0)
```

**Key Points**
- Ensure the `**detail_url**` function is correctly defined to generate the URL for a specific recipe's detail view.
- These tests comprehensively cover the scenarios of adding new tags, reassigning existing tags, and clearing tags
from a recipe.
- The `**format='json'**` parameter in the patch method call ensures that the request payload is correctly handled as
JSON.

These tests will help ensure that your recipe management functionality correctly handles the creation, assignment,
and clearing of tags, which are critical aspects of a recipe-tag management system. Remember to run these tests
after implementing the corresponding update functionality in your API to confirm that everything is working as intended.

## Step 11. Implement update recipe tags feature

Your implementation in `**recipe/serializers.py**` effectively adds the functionality to update a recipe's tags.
You've correctly abstracted the tag handling logic into a separate method (**_get_or_create_tags**) and used it in
both create and update methods. Here's a review of your implementation:

Updated **RecipeSerializer** in recipe/serializers.py

```python
#recipe/serializers.py


class RecipeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """Serializer for recipes."""
    tags = TagSerializer(many=True, required=False)
    
    # Others methods...
    
    def _get_or_create_tags(self, tags, recipe):
        """Handle getting or creating tags as needed. """
        auth_user = self.context['request'].user
        for tag in tags:
            tag_obj, created = Tag.objects.get_or_create(
                user=auth_user,
                **tag,
            )
            recipe.tags.add(tag_obj)
            
    def create(self, validated_data):
        """Create a recipe."""

**Key Points and Suggestions**
- The `**_get_or_create_tags**` method is a clean way to handle tag creation and association with the recipe. 
It ensures that tags are either fetched or created and then added to the recipe.
- In the `**update**` method, you're correctly checking if tags are provided in the request. If so, existing
tags are cleared, and new ones are added. This approach allows for complete updating of the tags associated with a
recipe.
- Remember to handle edge cases where tag data might not be valid or where other fields of the recipe might
fail to update.
- Since the update method clears existing tags and adds new ones, it's important to ensure that this behavior is
intended and clearly communicated to API users, as it replaces all existing tags with the new set provided.

With this implementation, your API will support updating recipes' tags, enhancing the flexibility and usability
of your recipe management system. This functionality allows users to maintain up-to-date and accurate tags for
their recipes.
